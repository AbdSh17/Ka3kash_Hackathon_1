## Project Description
This project aims to design and prototype a smart system that monitors airflow conditions inside HVAC ducts and detects abnormal air leakage. Air leakage in ventilation systems leads to significant energy loss, increased operating cost, and reduced indoor comfort.

In addition to airflow monitoring, the system also measures air quality parameters inside the duct. Monitoring air quality helps ensure a safe indoor environment, detect the presence of contaminants or abnormal air conditions, and support proper system operation. Poor air quality can indicate ventilation issues, blockages, or leakage that may affect both system efficiency and occupant safety.

The proposed system focuses on combining airflow monitoring, air quality sensing, and active control mechanisms into a single low-cost, embedded solution. The system is designed as a modular add-on that can be integrated into existing HVAC ductwork, making it suitable for residential, commercial, and light industrial environments.

## Problem Context
In many HVAC installations, duct leakage occurs due to poor sealing, aging materials, or installation errors. Because ducts are usually hidden behind walls or ceilings, leaks often go unnoticed for long periods. As a result, ventilation fans and heating or cooling units operate longer than necessary to maintain desired indoor conditions, wasting energy and increasing system stress.

This project addresses the problem at the airflow and control level rather than structural duct repair.

## Proposed Approach
The system continuously monitors key airflow-related parameters such as air pressure, airflow rate, and air quality. A microcontroller processes sensor data to establish normal operating behavior. When abnormal conditions are detected, the system can take corrective action by controlling a mechanical airflow element and also notifying the user.

## Target Users
- Residential homeowners
- Commercial building operators

## Expected Outcome
A working prototype that demonstrates detection of air leakage conditions and active airflow control, supported by clear documentation, system diagrams, and test results.
