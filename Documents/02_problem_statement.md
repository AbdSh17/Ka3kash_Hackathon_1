# Problem Statement

HVAC systems use ducts to deliver conditioned air to indoor spaces. In real installations, a noticeable amount of this air is lost due to leakage in ducts caused by poor sealing, aging materials, or installation issues. These leaks are usually hidden and remain undetected for long periods.

Air leakage forces HVAC systems to work longer to maintain the desired temperature, leading to higher energy consumption, increased operating cost, and reduced efficiency. It can also cause uneven air distribution across different areas of a building.

In addition to energy loss, duct leakage can negatively affect air quality. Leaks may allow unfiltered or contaminated air to enter the system, creating unhealthy or unsafe indoor environments.

Most existing solutions rely on manual inspection or periodic testing, which does not provide continuous monitoring. As a result, air leakage and air quality issues are often detected late.

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of a simple, low-cost system that can continuously monitor airflow and air quality in HVAC ducts and identify leakage during normal operation.

## Supporting Statistics

- Studies by the U.S. Department of Energy report that **duct leakage can account for 20–30% of total conditioned air loss** in residential and commercial HVAC systems.  
  This loss directly translates into wasted energy and higher operating costs.

- Sealing air leaks around your home and adding insulation can help your home be more comfortable and energy efficient and *provide up to a 10% savings on your annual energy bills*

- Leaky ducts are a major source of energy loss and comfort problems, especially in residential buildings
