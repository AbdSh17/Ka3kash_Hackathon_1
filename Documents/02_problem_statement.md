# Problem Statement

Many HVAC systems rely on **gas-powered heating components**, such as furnaces or boilers, to provide indoor heating. In real-world installations, gas leakage may occur due to:

- Aging gas pipelines and fittings  
- Faulty or loose connections  
- Improper installation practices  
- Equipment malfunctions or wear over time  

These leaks often occur in HVAC rooms or enclosed spaces and can remain undetected for long periods.

Undetected gas leakage poses serious safety risks, including:
- Fire hazards and explosions  
- Carbon monoxide poisoning  
- Degradation of indoor air quality  

Because HVAC systems circulate air throughout a building, leaked gas can spread beyond the source, increasing the potential impact on occupants.

Most existing gas detection solutions rely on:
- Standalone gas or CO alarms  
- Manual inspection and periodic testing  

Such approaches do not provide continuous monitoring, system-level response, or integration with modern HVAC control systems. As a result, gas leaks are often detected late, after hazardous conditions have already developed.

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of a **simple, low-cost system** that can continuously monitor gas levels in HVAC environments, provide early-warning alerts, and support **manual or automated shutdown actions** during normal operation.


## Supporting Statistics

- According to the **National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)**, structure fires involving **flammable gases account for approximately 2–3% of all reported structure fires** in recent years, showing that gas-related fires remain a consistent and significant safety concern.

- NFPA research indicates that when **flammable gas escapes from a pipe or container**, these incidents are responsible for a **disproportionately high impact**, contributing to:
  - Around **18% of structure fires**
  - Approximately **17% of civilian fire-related deaths**
  - Nearly **20% of direct property damage losses**

- Fires in which **flammable gas is the first-ignited fuel source** are associated with more severe outcomes compared to many other types of structure fires, highlighting the importance of early gas detection and rapid response mechanisms.

- The **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** identifies fuel-burning HVAC equipment as a common source of indoor air pollutants, including carbon monoxide.
