# BME680 Environmental Sensor

## 1. General Description

The **BME680** is a digital environmental sensor designed to monitor **indoor air conditions**. It integrates multiple sensing elements in a single chip and is widely used in **HVAC systems, smart buildings, and air-quality monitoring applications**.

The sensor provides four main signals:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Gas resistance

The BME680 does **not** measure gas concentration (ppm) and does **not** identify specific gases. Instead, it detects **changes in air composition** and overall **air-quality trends**.

## 2. Gas Sensor and Air Quality Concept

### 2.1 What the Gas Sensor Measures

The gas sensor inside the BME680 is a **metal-oxide (MOX) sensor**. It works by heating a metal-oxide surface and measuring how its **electrical resistance** changes when exposed to gases in the air.

The sensor is sensitive to:
- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Smoke
- Solvents and alcohol vapors
- General indoor air pollutants

The output of the gas sensor is:
- **Gas resistance (Ω)**

---

### 2.2 Meaning of Gas Resistance

Gas resistance is an **indirect indicator of air quality**.

General behavior:
- **High resistance → clean air**
- **Low resistance → polluted air**

The exact resistance value is **not important by itself**. What matters is how the resistance **changes over time** relative to normal conditions.

---

## 3. Determining Air Quality from Gas Resistance

### 3.1 Baseline Resistance

To determine air quality, the system first establishes a **baseline gas resistance**:

- The sensor is powered on
- A warm-up period is allowed
- Gas resistance is sampled in normal air
- An average value is stored as `R_baseline`

This baseline represents **clean or normal air** for that specific environment.

---

### 3.2 Air Quality Ratio

Air quality is calculated by comparing the current resistance to the baseline:

- Air Quality Ratio = R_current / R_baseline


Interpretation:
- Ratio ≈ 1.0 → clean air
- Ratio < 1.0 → degrading air quality
- Lower ratio → worse air quality

This ratio is dimensionless and easy to use in software.

## 4. Temperature Signal

### 4.1 What Temperature Represents

The temperature sensor measures ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).

Typical indoor range:
- 15 °C to 35 °C

---

### 4.2 Relation to Gas Sensor and Air Quality

Temperature affects:
- Gas reaction speed on the sensor surface
- Gas resistance stability

Higher temperatures generally reduce gas resistance, while lower temperatures increase it. Sudden temperature changes can cause **temporary resistance shifts** that are not related to air quality.

Temperature data is mainly used to:
- Provide environmental context
- Explain unexpected gas resistance changes

---

## 5. Humidity Signal

### 5.1 What Humidity Represents

The humidity sensor measures **relative humidity (%RH)**, which describes the amount of moisture in the air.

Typical indoor range:
- 30 % to 60 % RH

---

### 5.2 Relation to Gas Sensor and Air Quality

Humidity has a **strong effect** on the gas sensor.

General effect:
- Increased humidity → decreased gas resistance
- Decreased humidity → increased gas resistance

This means humidity changes can **look like air-quality changes** even when no pollutants are present.

Humidity data is used to:
- Detect false air-quality drops
- Improve reliability of gas-based air-quality estimation

---

## 6. Pressure Signal

### 6.1 What Pressure Represents

The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa).

Typical range:
- 980–1030 hPa

---

### 6.2 Relation to Gas Sensor and Air Quality

Pressure does not directly affect gas resistance, but it can provide useful context such as:
- Airflow changes
- Ventilation events

Pressure is optional for basic air-quality detection.

---

## 7. Warm-Up and Stability

When the BME680 is first powered on:
- Gas resistance drifts significantly
- Readings are unstable for several minutes

This is normal behavior for metal-oxide gas sensors.

Correct operation requires:
- A warm-up period
- Fixed heater configuration
- Constant sampling interval

Baselines must only be captured **after stabilization**.

---

## 8. Key Concept Summary

- The BME680 measures **environmental signals**, not air quality directly
- Gas resistance reflects **relative air contamination**
- Temperature and humidity strongly affect gas readings
- Air quality is determined by **comparing current values to a baseline**
- The sensor is best suited for **trend detection**, not absolute measurement
